```

## Installation & Setup

   - Place them in the same folder/directory

2. **Launch the App**
   - Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser
   - No server setup required - runs completely in the browser

3. **File Dependencies**
   - Make sure all files are in the same directory
   - The HTML file links to `styles.css` and `script.js`
   - Do not rename the CSS or JS files unless you update the HTML links

## Usage

### Adding Tasks
- Type your task in the input field
- Click "Add Task" button or press Enter
- Task will appear as a new card in the grid

### Managing Tasks
- **Complete Task**: Click the checkbox to mark as done
- **Delete Task**: Click the "Delete" button (confirms before deletion)
- **View Stats**: Check the statistics bar for task counts

## Browser Compatibility

- âœ… Chrome (recommended)
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Safari
- âœ… Edge
- âœ… Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit `styles.css` to modify the color scheme:
- Main gradient: Look for `background: linear-gradient(135deg, #d4a574 0%, #b8860b 100%)`
- Header colors: Search for `.header` styles
- Button colors: Modify `.add-btn` and `.delete-btn` styles

### Adjusting Grid Size
In `styles.css`, modify the grid template:
```css
.tasks-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
}
```
Change `200px` to make cards larger or smaller.

### Adding Features
The JavaScript is modular and easy to extend:
- Add new functions to `script.js`
- Task data is stored in the `tasks` array
- Use `renderTasks()` to refresh the display after changes

## Technical Details

- **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Data Storage**: Tasks stored in memory (resets on page refresh)
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid with mobile-first approach
- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth animations and interactions

## Troubleshooting

**Tasks disappear on refresh**
- This is normal behavior - tasks are stored in browser memory only
- To persist data, you would need to add localStorage functionality

**Styling looks broken**
- Ensure `styles.css` is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Check that the file isn't corrupted or partially downloaded

**JavaScript not working**
- Ensure `script.js` is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Check browser console (F12) for any error messages
- Make sure you're opening the HTML file in a browser, not a text editor
